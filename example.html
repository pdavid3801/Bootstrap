              <p class="first-content">If you're a scuba diver, the world is pretty much your oyster. If Earth is 71 percent water, just imagine how many places you can explore by taking a dive. 
                  Becoming a diver takes you to places all around the world; tropical paradises, ancient mayan cenotes, wrecks that tell secrets, underwater cave systems, fresh water lakes filled with mystery... You name it! The list is endless just like diving adventures!

              <h4>You'll encounter creatures unlike any other you've seen</h4>
              <p class="second-content">The ocean is a magical place! As soon as you submerge, your eyes will access a whole new dimension filled with marine life and biodiversity overall! Bright coral reefs, flashy invertebrates, curious marine mammals and an unbelievable array of colorful fish.
                  Each dive you take will be totally unique and trust us, there's no greater feeling than seeing a new species for the very first time. Whether your looking at some wild dolphins dance, listening to whales sing in chorus or swimming next to a giant whale shark, diving is something that will always surprise you.
